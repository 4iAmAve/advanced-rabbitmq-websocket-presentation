# Svelte app / UMD Module

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

We use it to build an UMD dummy module for the web integration platform. It serves as a PoC for a svelte integration as well as a test module to trigger various PubSub events in the platform.
